Image classification for CIFAR-10 dataset
In this project, i have ceated image classification using convolution neural network on CIFAR-10 dataset. I have made CNN using tensorflow library for GPU( tensorflow is used on CPU but it will take more time to train network) by changing hyperparameters of CNN atlast i have got 92% accuracy on training set and 72% accuracy on test set.

follow isntruction in code specially changing path for datatset and weights file and also test images and run code(Image_Classification.py.py) for training.

if training completed just run Image_Classification.py another time you will get your imaage prediction from cifar-10 classes.
